# Search Adaptor

The Search Adaptor is a thin wrapper of the Elasticsearch. It handles data indexing and reindexing into the backend Elasticsearch. It also accepts the search query and passes through to the Elasticsearch with data access security check.  This adaptor can be used to create a RESTful web service interface into an Elasticsearch store where multiple indice pairs can be created, with each indice pair documents being transformed by separately provided transformer code.  Each index in a pair is used for access level- ALL vs PUBLIC, where all documents are included in the ALL index and only PUBLICALLY available documents are added to the PUBLIC index. On a GET/search request the adaptor will check a user's credentials sending the request to the ALL or PUBLIC index depending on the user's access level.  Several layers of Translation can be provided to morph the data on the way to the indices.
